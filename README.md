## Projects

- [Graduation Admission Data Analysis](https://github.com/vamshi-arza/Graduate-admissiondata-RStudio-MachineLearning)
  
  - This project predicts graduate admission chances using machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. The Kaggle dataset includes GRE scores, TOEFL scores, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research Experience, and Chance of Admit. After preprocessing and cross-validation, Random Forest performed best. The analysis highlights the significance of CGPA and GRE scores in graduate admissions.
 
  - Tools Used : R, R Studio, Caret, Keras and TensorFlow 
  
- [Cricket(Sport) Data Analysis](https://github.com/vamshi-arza/CricketSport-Data_Analysis-AWS-Python-PySpark)

  - This project uses PySpark to analyze IPL cricket data from CSV files in an S3 bucket. It calculates runs, identifies impactful balls, and examines toss and win margins. Data cleaning involved filtering invalid entries and normalizing player names. Key insights include total runs per over, win margin categories, and toss-winner correlations. Technologies used are Apache Spark, PySpark, AWS S3, and Databricks, offering analytics on match performance and player statistics.

  - Tools Used : Amazon S3, Databricks, Python, SQL, PySpark
     
- [Superstore Data Analysis](https://github.com/vamshi-arza/Store_Data_Analysis-AWS-Qucksight-S3-Athena)

  - The Superstore Data Analysis project used a Kaggle dataset and various AWS services for efficient data processing and visualization. Data was filtered by order_date, uploaded to Amazon S3, and indexed using AWS Glue. AWS Athena facilitated querying, and AWS QuickSight was used for visualization. This project demonstrates the integration of AWS tools for deriving actionable insights from the superstore dataset.

  - Tools Used : AWS IAM, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, AWS QuickSight
       
- [HR Workforce Data Analysis](https://github.com/vamshi-arza/HR-Workforce-MySQL-PowerBI)

  - This project uses MySQL to analyze an HR dataset, clean data, and perform exploratory analysis. The dataset includes employee details like IDs, birthdates, hire and termination dates, gender, race, and job information. Key tasks included standardizing dates, calculating ages, and exploring gender and race distributions, age groups, employment locations, job titles, departmental turnover rates, and changes in employee count over time. The analysis helps HR make informed decisions on hiring, retention, and workforce management.
 
  - Tools Used : MySQL, PowerBI
    
- [Data Visualization Projects (Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/satya.sai.vamshi.krishna.arza/vizzes)

  - I utilized Tableau Public for creating interactive and insightful visualizations. Tableau Public allowed me to effectively present complex data in a clear and accessible manner, facilitating deeper analysis and understanding. My visualizations included trend analysis, distribution plots, and comparative charts, providing valuable insights from the data.
 
  - Tools Used : MySQL, Tableau
